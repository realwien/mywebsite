                    <p>
                        I am a Master's graduate in Communication and New Media at the National University of Singapore, where I also completed my Bachelor’s degree in Social Sciences (Hons). My research explores how cultural norms and social structures intersect with everyday technologies, shaping communication and engagement in both digital and physical spaces.
                        <br><br> Currently, I am a full-time research assistant for two projects:
                        <a href="https://casmida.com/" target="_blank">CASMIDA</a>, which focuses on technology-facilitated sexual violence and campus sexual misconduct, and 
                        <a href="https://queermeninsg.wordpress.com/our-research/" target="_blank">Queer Men in Singapore</a>, which explores the lived experiences and challenges faced by queer men in Singapore.                         
                        <br><br> My work spans diverse topics, including gender studies, the Metaverse, embodiment, cultural cringe, and media.
                        I have presented and written about topics such as virtual fashion in Decentraland, how older adults in Singapore navigate the digital landscape, and cultural cringe amongst Singaporean youth. 
                        <br><br> Outside of my academic work, you can find me curled up comfortably with a science fiction novel, exploring spice-laden cuisines, or mapping out my next travel adventure.

                        This paper, co-authored with a friend as part of graduate coursework, explores the interplay between nationalism and cultural perception in Singapore. 
                        <br>We argue that those who align strongly with Singapore’s nationalism view local cultural expressions not as subpar Western replicas but as emblems of Singaporean pride.
